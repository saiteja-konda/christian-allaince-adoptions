                                Around the world, millions of children are waiting for a permanent family. Children of all ages, infants and up, are waiting to be adopted in countries such as China, Hong Kong, South Korea, India, Ethiopia, and others throughout South America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.  Unlike in the United States, most of these children are growing up in orphanages. As a result, families who feel called to orphan adoption often choose to adopt internationally.

                                International adoption is the adventure of a lifetime — but while this is an exciting process, it is also a complex one. Hopeful parents must coordinate not only with the one or two U.S. adoption agencies and the U.S. government, but also with the government of another country.

                                Once you have selected a country from which to adopt, you can begin searching for international adoption agencies that have programs in that country.

FCCA will still provide the home study, post-placement and re-adoption services needed to complete your adoption.

Your child-placing agency will send you an adoption dossier checklist to assist in this process. The dossier paperwork will be sent to the California Secretary of State’s office for apostilling and authentication, then to your child-placing agency and onto the child’s country for approval.

First, it is required by California regulations by all families adopting a child internationally. In some cases it is required for the child to become a U.S. citizen. Second, the re-adoption process results in a new California birth certificate (in English) naming you as the parents of your child.

After you complete all the required visits and FCCA submits the reports to the placing agency and sending country, FCCA will assist California families with finalizing the adoption or re-adoption in court.
