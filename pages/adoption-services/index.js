                                Unlike traditional foster care programs, the Alabama Waiting Child Program focuses on low legal-risk placements, by placing children who are on track to be freed for adoption and are thus very unlikely to be reunited with their birth families.

                                Our agency also works with a number of expectant mothers each year who contact us to make adoption plans for their babies. Families who want to be considered for these infant adoption opportunities may submit an adoption profile after their home study has been approved. CAAFK will keep this profile on file and notify the family of any potential matches. Subject to certain restrictions, families interested in domestic infant adoption may also be enrolled simultaneously in our fos-adopt or international adoption programs.

                                Independent adoption is another type of domestic infant adoption in which the birth parents personally select and transfer custody to the adoptive parents without agency involvement. While an agencyâ€™s matching services are not used in independent adoption, Alabama law requires the adoptive family to hire an Adoption Service Provider (ASP) to provide the following services:
